## Product Description

Skin is the outermost part of our body that is very vulnerable to contamination. Also, skin can spread easily to other people but skin health has a lack of concern especially for people that are prone to skin diseases like swimmers, construction workers, etc. The Skin Disease Detection Application came up to be the solution, to people who have skin diseases so that they can diagnose earlier, take prevention and take action earlier or buy the recommended medicine, as easy as taking a photo of their skin so the app can define what the disease is. We also provide information as articles that can be read to educate people about the skin disease, including about the disease, how to prevent the disease, is the disease indicates other diseases, etc. To validate our dataset that we got from Kaggle, we also consult the data to Dermatologist so we can verify that the dataset, information that we give, and medicine that we recommend was correct.

We hope that this project will help people to diagnose their skin diseases, fewer people that are infected with skin disease and spread importance about skin diseases.
